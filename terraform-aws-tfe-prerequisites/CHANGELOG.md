# Changes

## Examples

- All `terraform.auto.tfvars` have been renamed to `terraform.auto.tfvars.example` to encourage people to read through the file as the `plan` / `apply` operation will prompt for inputs
- All examples now use the `v0.2.0` of the `terraform-aws-tfe` module
- All `README.MD` files have been updated in the examples
- All TFE examples that use Replicated now use the input `tls_bootstrap_type` in the deployment module. This utilizes a generated certificate for the TFE instance instead of using the Replicated self-signed cert. In the future when deploying FDO a certificate is **REQUIRED** as Replicated isn't present to generate them. This was done to encourage users to generate certificates as a part of the deployment. You can change the value of the input back to `self-signed` if you want to use a self-signed certificate as a part of a demo or deployment with a Replicated instance (not recommended).
- Defaults for variables in the examples have been removed 
- üóëÔ∏è `public-tfe-active-standby-aurora-alb` has been removed
- üóëÔ∏è `public-tfe-active-standby-aurora-nlb` has been removed
- üóëÔ∏è `public-tfe-active-active-nlb` has been removed
- üóëÔ∏è `public-tfe-active-active-alb` has been removed

- ‚ûï `public-tfe-fdo-active-nlb` has been added
- ‚ûï `public-tfe-fdo-active-alb` has been added
- ‚ûï `hvd-tfe` has been added

- Variables have been added across all examples to make them easy to manage and easy for end users to consume. Shifted inputs to `terraform.auto.tfvars` for execution.

## Variables

### Networking

- `vpc_default_security_group_egress` has been added. This allows for a list of maps of egress rules to be set on the default security group that would be created when setting `create_vpc = true` 
- `vpc_default_security_group_ingress` has been added. This allows for a list of maps of ingress rules to be set on the default security group that would be created when setting `create_vpc = true` 
- `vpc_endpoint_flags` has been added. This allows for the VPC endpoints to be created conditionally based on the user's use case
- `vpc_option_flags` has been added. This allows for specific optional flags to be set on the VPC when `create_vpc = true` 

## Taskfile
- Taskfile has been updated to allow for branches to be specified when generating a bundle. Additional support for cloud names to be specified via a variable in the task.
- Output artifact that is generated is now using the naming convention `{{.DEPLOY_DIR}}-bundle.zip`. This means the artifact will be named `terraform-aws-tfe-bundle.zip` 
- Sub folders within the zip are now clearer. The should be named `terraform-aws-tfe` and `terraform-aws-tfe-prerequisites`
